This chapter discusses the computational basis of learning and cognition. To deal with a continuously changing environment, living things have three choices: (1) evolve unvarying processes that usually succeed, (2) evolve genetically fixed effector, perceptual, and computational functions that are contingent on the environment, and (3) learn adaptive functions during their lifetimes. The theme of this chapter is the relation between (2) and (3): the nature of evolutionarily determined computational processes that support learning. The principal goal of this chapter has been to suggest that high-dimensional vector space computations based on empirical associations among very large numbers of components could be a close model of a fundamental computational basis of most learning in both verbal and perceptual domains. More powerful representational effects can be brought about by linear inductive combinations of the elements of very large vocabularies than has often been realized. Success of one such model to demonstrate many natural properties of language commonly assumed to be essentially more complex, nonlinear, and/or unlearned, along with evidence and argument that similar computations may serve similar roles in object recognition, are taken to reaffirm the possibility that a single underlying associational mechanism lies behind many more special and complex appearing cognitive phenomena."

abstract= {Course Description
Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent developments in neural network (aka “deep learning”) approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. The final assignment will involve training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it on the largest image classification dataset (ImageNet). We will focus on teaching how to set up the problem of image recognition, the learning algorithms (e.g. backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning the networks and guide the students through hands-on assignments and a final course project. Much of the background and materials of this course will be drawn from the ImageNet Challenge.},
